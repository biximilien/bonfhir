# What is Bonfhir?

Bonfhir is meant as a collection of [open-source building blocks (technically NPM packages)](/packages/foundation/core) that can be used to create products and solutions based on
the [HL7 FHIR standard](https://hl7.org/fhir/).

[Quoting the FHIR executive summary](https://hl7.org/fhir/summary.html):

> FHIRÂ® â€“ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources â€“ is a next generation standards framework created by HL7.
> FHIR combines the best features of HL7's v2 , HL7 v3 and CDA product lines while leveraging the latest web standards and applying a tight focus on implementability.

> FHIR solutions are built from a set of modular components called "Resources".
> These resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
> FHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts â€“ mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.

Our goal is to provide resources to help our fellow developers quickly implement solutions in the healthcare industry.
We also want to foster and participate in a healthy ecosystem around [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir), which we believe to be a viable path to implement open, interoperable health-related solutions.

Come [explore our current list of packages](/packages/foundation/core), and/or [contribute to the project](/contributing/contributing) ðŸš€.
